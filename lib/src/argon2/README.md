# Argon2 package

Argon2 package implements FFI wrappers for native C code in order to improve performance.

These wrappers are used by dart's `package:argon2_ffi_base` package.

At the moment ZNN Dart SDK only supports statically built libraries which are provided with this SDK in the `blobs/`
subfolder.

In the future we plan to open-source the codebase & documentation for these libraries so that developers and users alike
can build these libraries, without the need to trust the provided libraries.
